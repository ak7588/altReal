# Project 1 Idea Proposal

For this project, I got inspired by the TV Series called *Snowpiercer*.

"*Snowpiercer* is an American post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller television drama series that premiered on TNT on May 17, 2020. It is based on both the 2013 film of the same name, directed by Bong Joon-ho and the 1982 French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette, from which the film was adapted." (Wikipedia)

After watching this show, I started to have a series of nightmare-dreams about living in the *Snowpiercer* reality. Combining the TV-show's aesthetics as well as some elements from my imagination, I want to create an environment of a post-apocalyptic train station.

The theme of the environment is modern, gothic -- and dark overall. There might be a few sounds used for a better immersion. I am planning to download free Unity assets from the Asset Store and see how they fit the environment.
