# WELCOME TO THE ALTREAL TRAIN REALITY!

To start the project, please clone the altReal repository. After successfully cloning the main repository, please open the Unity Hub and run the Project-1-Snowpiercer directory to initialize the project. The Unity will open the main scene of the project, which is already configured to be connected to a VR device. The gaming scene can then be played either through the computer or the VR device.
