## Introduction

For this project, I got inspired by the TV Series called *Snowpiercer*.

"*Snowpiercer* is an American post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller television drama series that premiered on TNT on May 17, 2020. It is based on both the 2013 film of the same name, directed by Bong Joon-ho and the 1982 French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette, from which the film was adapted." (Wikipedia)

After watching this show, I started to have a series of nightmare-dreams about living in the *Snowpiercer* reality. Combining the TV-show's aesthetics as well as some elements from my imagination, I want to create an environment of a post-apocalyptic train station.

The theme of the environment is modern, gothic -- and dark overall. There might be a few sounds used for a better immersion. I am planning to download free Unity assets from the Asset Store and see how they fit the environment.

## ALTREAL Environment

When the user enters the project, they are presented with a scene of the train station in the winter. The user is placed between the train station building and the train. The scene consists of the nature (mountains, snow, gloomy skybox) as well as the architecture elements (abandoned buildings, railroad, trash and boxes). For the immersive experience, sounds of the snow blizzard and the train station announcements can be heard. After a few announcements, the train takes off from the station and leaves the user behind.

## Unity Process

I started off by creating the scene of the Altreal Train Station. After downloading assets of the landscape, trains, and abandoned buildings, the final train station came to life. I added special skybox effects, such as moving clouds, to add the winter storm effect.

When the visual environment was built, I added a few immersive elements that could convey the meaning of the story -- a horror train station and a rushing train that leaves the user behind. To reinforce this experience, I made a timeline and added sounds and animation that "show-and-tell" what is happening in the scene.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was thinking of design choices for the scene. With an abundance of assets, sounds, and other visual elements, it sometimes was a daunting task to choose a specific element. To resolve this, I decided to start off with an empty scene and asked myself: what makes a train station? Can my environment still look like a train station if I remove X, Y, Z elements from the scene? Answering these questions helped to clean the scene and, hopefully, portray the right feeling for the user. I need to add that getting feedback from my peers (a.k.a user-testing) helped me see missing elements (such as adding sound effects to convey the rush) and improve the scene overall.

For example, this is the scene before getting feedback:

Another significant challenge was getting over the learning curve of using Unity. Adding C# scripts, animations, and establishing the timeline would be much more difficult to manage if not the previously recorded labs from the class.

## Reflections and Next Steps

Overall, I am feeling good about the final result of this project. However, that is not to say that there cannot be any improvements. In the next few steps, I would think how to make the scene more immersive _and_ interactive for the user. What other sound or visual effects can be added? What elements can become interactive? Does this portray the scene or the feeling I am going for? Exploring different assets and seeing other similar - if not more advanced - projects would help going forward.
