This Bonsai Zen Garden is a Unity-made environment. Aside from the downloaded forest assets, the following packages were used in the Bonsai's creation:
- Universal RP
- Probuilder
- Polybrush
- Progrids

Having never used advanced Unity packages, I found polybrush and probuilder very useful tools to have in making any environment. Downloading and learning to use these tools was challenging at first, but with more practice I seemed to understand them more. Getting used to Unity's GUI is also something that is in progress for me.

Playing around with different building and creation modes allowed for more creativity in my work. When I was using packages and assets, it reminded me of building my own house-yard in Sims (which I was obsessed with in middle school).

In my future projects, I would love to practice Unity tools to get more comfortable with building complex environments.
